- when user is deleted & the a new user with the same name is created the projects still exist (get rid of them)
- make questions more specific (guide user to know what research they must do to answer the important questions for making a idea to a product)
- mysubmissions ui is so fat so make it compact & add more info down/up arrow buttons
- languages only change some text so make it change all text
- change required to the names of the inputs when making submissions
- make this website load without wifi & work without wifi (only with downloaded app if necessary)
- replace current language translations with languages hindi, bengali, telugu, marathi, and tamil, gujurati, urdu, malayalam
- make textboxes expand dynamically
- change the formal language to conversational (e.g. hey *name of user selected* blah blah blah...)
- dont be so harsh with grading. emphasize pros & cons not separating feedback by category but bullet points of pros & cons, unless the idea is absolutely awful it shouldn't be less than 70/100. give encouraging words. encourage them to look at their environment if their idea looks like its 80% or more likely made by ai.
- subtitles should not be so small (they shouold be bigger than the bullet points)
- check if they fixed issues from previous draft
- remember previous score when judging second & or 3rd draft to see if they iterated  & if they did good and their score is over 80 they will put their email & connected to a mentor soon.
- tell user to conduct customer interviews after they submit first draft (they can't submit for _ days/weeks)
- if ai gives low score, give alot of detailed feedback compared to if it gives a high score give it reasonably lengthened feedback
- the feedback questions for the user to help the developer improve the product at the ideas page has simply 1 vague question so add above it open-ended specific questions about the product

questions to implement for second draft:
- did you conduct any form of research of market validation to validate your idea necessity?
- how thouroughly did you research your competitors
- did you develop an mvp (e.g. website, app,) (optional) (if they say no, add a little optional question to ask why they didn't)
- upload photo if physical product (lets ask sahasra since their camera might be bad and idk a model MAY be able to detect if it's good or not)

questions & features to implement for third draft:
- pitch your idea like your talking to an investor (show an example)
- allow side bar to show previous drafts (select 1st or 2nd draft to look at it so they can collect their ideas for their final draft to submit (3rd draft)).
- what research have you done? (to test your idea/put it out there)
- did you develop an mvp (e.g. website, app,) (optional, if yes then put link here)
